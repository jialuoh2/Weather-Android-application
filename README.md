Milestone 3 Video Steps
</br>1. Starting the app, where it shows the login page
</br>2. Sign up for “two users” Please use the NetID of two team members as usernames - ren28,lian7. Use different layouts for each user to show UI customization - Dark and Light Theme
</br>3. Sign in with the first user credentials(ren28) and show the empty list 
</br>4. Add three locations (three arbitrary cities to the list of locations for the first user - Chicago,Vancouver,Durban)
</br>5. Log off (redirect to authentication page)
</br>6. Sign in with the second user credentials (lian7) and show the empty list of locations
</br>7. Add four locations (arbitrary cities but different from the first user locations- New York,Beijing,New Delhi,Tokyo )
</br>8. Log off (redirect to authentication page)
</br>9. Log in with the first user credentials(ren28) and see the list of cities added in Step 4
</br>10. Remove a city from the list (you should show that the list is updated - removed city Durban)
</br>11. Log off (redirect to authentication page)
</br>12. Log in with the second user credentials(lian7) and see the list of cities added in Step 7
